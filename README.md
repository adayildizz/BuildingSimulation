# Interactive World Building Game

![Demo Screenshot](./screenshots/Objects.png)

## Abstract

Our project is a world builder game in which the player has a modifiable terrain (digging, elevating, and flattening). The player can paint terrain with textures (snow, dirt, grass), place objects (cottage house, cat, dog), and experience a realistic day/night cycle with shadows.

## Features

- **Procedural Terrain System**

  - 250x250 grid with heightmaps (flat, volcanic, crater, fault)
  - Real-time digging, raising, flattening, painting

- **Camera System**

  - Perspective projection, movement, rotation
  - Rodrigues‚Äôs formula for pitch to avoid gimbal lock

- **Dynamic Lighting**

  - Continuous day/night cycle
  - Celestial simulation with sun/moon movement
  - Blinn-Phong shading

- **Shadows**

  - Two-pass shadow mapping (depth-buffer based)
  - Dynamic bias to reduce artifacts

- **Water Rendering**

  - Reflection & refraction with DuDv & normal maps
  - Fresnel blending for realism

- **Object Management**

  - Object loading via Assimp
  - Transformations (translation, rotation, scaling)
  - Factory pattern for centralized object setup

- **UI System**

  - Lightweight UI with buttons and dropdown menus
  - Cascading dropdown animation

- **Raycasting**
  - Cursor-to-grid intersection for terrain manipulation & object placement
